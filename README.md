# Coral Reefs Management System

## Overview
Coral Reefs, or also can be called as Ocean rainforest, although only has a population of approximately 0.01% but is able to protect about 25% of all life in the sea from various species of fish and other invertebrate creatures [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/coral-reefs/#:~:text=Reefs%20provide%20a%20large%20fraction%20of%20Earth%E2%80%99s%20biodiversity%E2%80%94they%20have%20been%20called%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20rain%20forests%20of%20the%20seas.%E2%80%9D%20Scientists%20estimate%20that%2025%20percent%20of%20all%20marine%20species%20live%20in%20and%20around%20coral%20reefs%2C%20making%20them%20one%20of%20the%20most%20diverse%20habitats%20in%20the%20world.)[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://coral.org/en/coral-reefs-101/#:~:text=Although%20they%20cover%20less%20than%200.1%25%20of%20the%20earth%E2%80%99s%20surface%2C%20coral%20reefs%20are%20the%20most%20biodiverse%20marine%20ecosystem%20in%20the%20world.). In addition, this ecosystem is very useful in protecting the shoreline [<sup>[3]</sup>](https://resourcewatch.org/dashboards/coral-reefs#:~:text=Reefs%20protect%20an%20estimated%20150%2C000%20km%20of%20shoreline%20in%20more%20than%20100%20countries%20and%20territories.%C2%A0On%20average%2C%20coral%20reefs%20reduce%20the%20annual%20expected%20damages%20from%20storms%20globally%20by%20more%20than%20US%244%20billion.), supporting the community's economy especially in tourist areas [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://coral.org/en/coral-reefs-101/#:~:text=Over%20100%20countries%20benefit%20from%20the%20recreational%20value%20of%20coral%20reefs)[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://resourcewatch.org/dashboards/coral-reefs#:~:text=Coral%20reefs%20are%20an%20important%20magnet%20for%20both%20domestic%20and%20international%20tourism%20in%20over%20100%20countries%20and%20territories%2C%20generating%20jobs%2C%20revenue%20and%20foreign%20exchange.), and even could be used as secrets source of medicine in the future. The Coral Reefs that located in Raja Ampat (Indonesia) according to the Goldman Environmental Prize winner, are the healthiest compared to Coral Reefs in other regions (which experiencing vulnerability and bleaching) [<sup>[4]</sup>](https://www.goldmanprize.org/blog/protecting-the-remarkable-coral-reefs-of-raja-ampat-indonesia/#:~:text=Zafer%20is%20optimistic,in%20other%20places.). Jump back in 2022 the UN Biodiversity Convention parties said that by 2030, around 30% of the world's terrestrial, inland water, coastal, and marine areas must be in effective protection and management [<sup>[4]</sup>](https://www.goldmanprize.org/blog/protecting-the-remarkable-coral-reefs-of-raja-ampat-indonesia/#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20in%202022%20the%20parties%20to%20the%20UN%20Biodiversity%20Convention%20called%20for%2030%25%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20terrestrial%2C%20inland%20water%2C%20coastal%2C%20and%20marine%20areas%20to%20be%20in%20effective%20protection%20and%20management%20by%202030%20(emphasis%20added)). Therefore, in order to maintain, monitor, and improve continuously of the Coral Reefs especially in Raja Ampat (Indonesia), which then serve as the best example worldwide, need to be digitized seamlessly with this Coral Reefs Management System Program made using Python.
